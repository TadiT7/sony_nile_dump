<div class="section"><p>Simple steps can help reduce your level of exposure to radio frequencies. To minimize your mobile deviceâ€™s transmit power, be sure to use it under optimal reception conditions, as indicated by the signal strength on the display. In general, the closer you are to an operator antenna, the lower the power used by the mobile device.</p><p>Current scientific information does not indicate that the use of mobile devices requires any special precautions. However, organizations such as the World Health Organization and the Food and Drug Administration recommend that those who wish to minimize exposure to radio frequencies should reduce their duration of mobile device usage, and use a hands-free accessory when possible to distance the device from the head and body. In accordance with the French legislation in force, we are required to inform you that it is recommended to remove the phone from the belly of pregnant women and the lower abdomen of children and adolescents.</p></div>
