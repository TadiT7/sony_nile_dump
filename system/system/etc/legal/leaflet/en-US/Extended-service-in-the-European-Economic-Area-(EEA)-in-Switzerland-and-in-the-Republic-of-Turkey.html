<p>If you have purchased your device in a country/region that is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), in Switzerland, or in the Republic of Turkey and such device was intended for sale in the EEA, Switzerland, or Turkey, you can have your device serviced in any EEA country/region, Switzerland, or Turkey under the warranty conditions prevailing in the country/region in which you require servicing, provided that an identical device is sold in such country/region by an authorized <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> distributor. To find out if your device is sold in the country/region you are in, please call your local <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> Contact Center. Please keep in mind that certain services may not be possible elsewhere than in the country/region of original purchase, such as due to the fact that your device may have an interior or exterior which is different from equivalent models sold in other countries/regions. Please note in addition that it may sometimes not be possible to repair SIM-locked devices.</p>
