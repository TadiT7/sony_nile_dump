<li><span class="li-content"><p>This limited warranty is valid only if the original proof of purchase for this device, issued by a Sony-authorized dealer specifying, unaltered, the date of purchase and serial number (in some countries/regions/states, other information may be requested), is presented with the device to be repaired or replaced. Sony reserves the right to refuse warranty service if this information has been removed or changed after the original purchase of the device from the dealer.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>If Sony repairs or replaces the device, the repair for the defect concerned or the replaced device shall be warranted for the remaining time of the original warranty period or for ninety (90) days from the date of repair, whichever is longer. Repair or replacement may involve the use of functionally equivalent reconditioned units. Replaced parts or components will become the property of Sony.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"> <p>This warranty does not cover any failure of the device that is due to:</p> <ul>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Normal wear and tear.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Use in environments where relevant IP rating limitations, if applicable, are exceeded (including liquid damage or the detection of liquid inside the device resulting from such use).</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Misuse or failure to use in accordance with the relevant Sony instructions for use and maintenance of the device. </p></span></li>
</ul><p>Nor does this warranty cover any failure of the Product due to accident, software or hardware modification or adjustment, or acts of God.</p> </span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>A rechargeable battery can be charged and discharged more than a hundred times. However, it will eventually wear out—this is not a defect and corresponds to normal wear and tear. When the talk time or standby time becomes noticeably shorter, it is time to replace the battery (only Sony Mobile repair partners should remove or replace built-in batteries). Sony recommends that you use only batteries and chargers approved by Sony.</p> <p>Minor variations in display brightness and color may occur between devices. There may be tiny bright or dark dots on the display. These are called defective pixels and occur when individual dots have malfunctioned and cannot be adjusted. Two defective pixels are deemed acceptable.</p> <p>Minor variations in camera image appearance may occur between devices. Such variations are not uncommon and do not mean that a camera module is defective.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Since the cellular system on which the device is to operate is provided by a carrier independent from Sony, Sony will not be responsible for the operation, availability, coverage, services, or range of that system.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"> <p>This warranty does not cover device failures caused by installations, modifications, or repair, or opening of the device performed by a person not authorized by Sony.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>The warranty does not cover device failures which have been caused by use of accessories or other peripheral devices which are not Sony-branded original accessories intended for use with the device.</p> </span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Sony disclaims any and all warranties, whether express or implied, for failures caused to the device or peripheral devices as a result of viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or other malicious software. Sony strongly recommends that you install appropriate virus protection software on your device and any peripheral devices connected to it, as available, and update this regularly to better protect your device. It is understood, however, that such software will never fully protect your device or its peripheral devices, and Sony disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied, in case of failure by such antivirus software to fulfill its intended purpose. </p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Tampering with any of the seals on the device will void the warranty.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"> <p><span class="">There are no express warranties, whether written or oral, other than this limited warranty. all implied warranties, including without limitation the implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, are limited to the duration of this limited warranty. In no event shall Sony or its licensors be liable for incidental or consequential damages of any nature whatsoever, including but not limited to lost profits or commercial loss to the full extent those damages can be disclaimed by law.</span> </p></span></li>
</ol></div>
<p> Some countries/regions/states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, or limitation of the duration of implied warranties, so the preceding limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
<p>The warranty provided does not affect the consumer’s statutory rights under applicable legislation in force or the consumer’s rights against the dealer arising from their sales/purchase contract. </p>
