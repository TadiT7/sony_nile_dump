<div class="section"> <p>This device
has been certified in compliance with the governmentÂ´s requirements
for exposure to radio waves. In the United States and Canada, the
SAR limit for devices used by the public is 1.6 watts/kilogram (W/kg)
averaged over one gram of body tissue. The standard incorporates a
margin of safety to give additional protection for the public and
to account for any variations in measurements.</p> <p>Before a device
is available for sale to the public in the US, it must be tested and
certified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that it does
not exceed the limit established by the government-adopted requirement
for safe exposure. The tests are performed in positions and locations
(i.e., by the ear and worn on the body) as required by the FCC for
each model. The FCC has granted an Equipment Authorisation for this
device with all reported SAR levels evaluated as in compliance with
the FCC RF exposure guidelines. While there may be differences between
the SAR levels of various devices, all devices granted an FCC equipment
authorisation meet the government requirement for safe exposure. SAR
information on this device is on file at the FCC and can be found
by entering the FCC ID of your device at: <a xmlns="" href="http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/">transition.fcc.gov/oet/ea/fccid/</a>. You can find the FCC ID by referring to the relevant label in your
device or through the <span class="label">Certificates</span> menu in <span class="label">Settings</span>.</p><p>For more information about SAR and radio
