device?</h2><div>
<p>A cellular device is a device that allows wireless electronic communication
over radio waves. For this purpose, the device is equipped with a
receiver and a transmitter, which maintain its connection to the nearest
base station in its vicinity, where the radio signal transmission
and reception antennas are located.</p>
<p>The antennas in the base station as well as the cellular device
produce radio emission in the process of cellular communication. The
level of radiation emitted by the cellular device is lower than that
which is emitted by the cellular transmission center (cellular site),
but as it is normally held right near the user’s body, the radio energy
is directly absorbed from the cellular device’s antenna. The device
operates in a frequency range of 800 to 2200 MHz. The maximum output
of most cellular devices currently in use is 0.6 watt.</p>
</div>
               

            </div>
            <div class="nested1" id="What-is-radio-emission"><h2>What is radio
emission?</h2><div>
<p>Radiation is the travel of energy through space or matter. Radiation
may be classified as follows according to the level of energy transmitted:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="li-content">Ionizing radiation (which carries enough energy to alter the structure
of atoms or molecules by liberating electrons, for example, X-rays)</span></li>
<li><span class="li-content">Non-ionizing radiation (which does not carry enough energy to
alter the structure of atoms or molecules, for example, radio waves)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Radio waves are non-ionizing electromagnetic waves, whose frequency
is lower than those of visible light, X-rays or gamma rays.</p>
</div>
               

            </div>
            <div class="nested1" id="The-level-of-radiation-emitted-by-the-device"><h2>The level of
radiation emitted by the device</h2><div>
<p>When using a cellular device, exposure of the head of the user
to radio waves is relatively high. The level of exposure to radiation
emitted by cellular devices is based on a measuring unit known as
SAR (which stands for Specific Absorption Rate) that describes the
quantity of radiant energy absorbed per unit of mass of tissue, such
as the human body. When measured, SAR is expressed in W/kg or mW/g.</p>
<p>Manufacturers perform SAR level tests, where a complete and fully
functional device is laboratory tested. The actual SAR level emitted
by the devices varies in fact. Generally, the closer the cellular
device is to the base station antenna, the lower the emitted SAR level
compared with the case in which the cellular device is further away
from the base station antenna or the signal reception in a given location
is poor.</p>
<p>The SAR measuring process is highly complicated and there are only
a few laboratories in the world that are qualified to perform SAR
testing. Manufacturers of cellular devices are compelled to have their
devices undergo rigorous SAR testing (for maximum transmission capacity)
in compliance with the American or European regulations, and specify
the maximum SAR level measured.</p>
<p>Due to the level of complexity of the test, the device does not
undergo periodic SAR testing. The SAR level of the device may deviate
as measured originally at any time in the product life due to possible
damage, maintenance work performed or any modifications made to its
original configuration. </p>
<p> The maximum permitted emission level by a cellular device asset
in the Consumer Protection Regulations (Information on non-ionizing
radiation emitted by cellular telephones) 5762 - 2002 is 2 watts per
kilogram (W/kg) taken over 10 g of tissue according to the European
measuring method, and 1.6 W/kg taken over a mass of 1 gram of tissue
according to the American measuring method.</p>

aspects</h2><div>
<p>Concerns for possibly adverse health impacts by the use of cellular
devices, and especially its link to cancer, have been raised ever
since cellular technology became available to the public in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The results of the first study were published in 1996 and the results
of several additional studies were published thereafter during the
beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. As a rule, these studies
did not indicate a rise in the risk for developing tumors among the
users, but all reports indicated that the latency period represented
in these studies was insufficient for the assessment of the possible
link between exposure to RF emission from cellular devices and the
development of cancer in the areas of the body exposed to this emission.</p>
<p>Several studies, including the INTERPHONE study co-ordinated by
the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), were published
during the last decade. 18 centers around the world took part in the
study. Their comprehensive analysis pointed at an increase in the
risk for developing cancer among those who have used a cellular device
for more than 10 years, in individuals who reported that they held
the cellular device on the side where the tumor developed, and among
individuals who were in the top usage category.</p>
<p>There is a debate in the scientific community as to whether these
findings are genuine or the result of methodological issues. In any
case, it should be mentioned that the maximal duration and extent
of use represented in these studies is limited compared to the current
extent of use of cellular devices (a latency period of up to 12 years
and 2 to 2.5 hours a month, as reported, for example, by half of the
participants in the INTERPHONE Study).</p>
<p>These studies examined the risk resulting from the exposure to
and the use of the end-user device, and not the environmental exposure
to radiation emitted by base stations and other radiation emitting
devices.</p>
<p>The uncertainty regarding the health hazards, on one hand, and
the wide exposure of the population (including children) on the other
hand, has brought most of the countries around the globe to take preventive
measures regarding exposure to radiation emitted by cellular technology.</p>
<p>In May 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),
part of the World Health Organization, classified radio frequency
electromagnetic fields as B2 carcinogenic to humans (possibly carcinogenic),
and hence has clearly expressed its support for an approach based
on preventive caution in this matter.</p>
<p>The position of the Ministry of Health is that in consideration
of the current study findings, it is necessary to continue abiding
by the principle of preventive caution.</p>

            <div class="nested1" id="Recommendations-of-the-Ministry-of-Health-regarding-the-use-of-cellular-devices"><h2>Recommendations
of the Ministry of Health regarding the use of cellular devices</h2><div>
<p>The Ministry of Health generally adopts the guidelines as set by
most international bodies that recommend the principle of “preventive
caution” in the use of cellular devices. In line with such guidelines,
the Ministry of Health has made the following recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="li-content">Using a speaker/cable-connected (not wireless) headset or earphones
and keeping the device away from the body, when used for telephone
calls, diminishes exposure to RF emissions. It is therefore recommended
to keep the device away from the body and not to carry it on the body
while it is used for telephone communication, for example, on a waist
belt, in one’s pocket or suspended from a neck strap. Minimizing the
amount and duration of calls made using the cellular device is an
additional, simple means for reducing exposure.</span></li>
<li><span class="li-content">The level of radiation emitted increases in locations where signal
reception is poor (such as those with relatively few antennas or places
such as elevators and trains, where electromagnetic shielding causes
reception interference). Therefore, using the device for telephone
calls should be avoided in such areas. The signal quality is clearly
indicated by the cellular device’s signal bar, which makes the identification
of a poor signal easy.</span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"> It is especially recommended to exercise preventive caution with
children, who are particularly prone to develop cancer when exposed
to carcinogenic factors. The effect on children of exposure to RF
emissions by cellular devices has not yet been studied, as the use
of cellular devices by children started significantly later than by
adults. It is recommended that special caution be exercised with regard
to children due to their age of physical development and sensitivity
to health issues, expected increase in life expectancy (and subsequently
expected increase of cumulative, significant exposure to emitted radiation
as well as long-term morbidity), and ethical issues involved in decisions
made regarding minors. For these reasons, the Ministry of Health recommends
that parents limit the exposure of children to cellular devices to
the extent possible, to consider the age at which a child may start
using such devices, to limit that use and in any case, to strictly
insist on the use of a cable-connected (not wireless) headset or earphones
or speaker when using the cellular device.</span></li>
<li><span class="li-content">When driving, it is important to limit the use of the cellular
device and in any case to adhere to Traffic Regulation 28b. This regulation
states: “while the vehicle is in motion, the driver may not hold a
fixed or portable telephone device and will not use them unless via
a speakerphone; and will not send or read a text message (SMS).” According
to this sub-regulation, “a speakerphone is a device that allows the
use of the telephone without holding it, and in case the speakerphone
is part of the telephone device itself, the latter will be set in
the vehicle in a stable manner, preventing its tripping.” In the case
of a telephone fixed in the vehicle, it is recommended to install
an external antenna and to favour a cord connection between the telephone
and the speaker over a Bluetooth wireless device.</span></li>
</ul>

            <div class="nested1" id="The-effect-of-cellular-devices-on-medical-equipment"><h2>The effect of
cellular devices on medical equipment</h2><div>
<p>Generally, modern medical equipment is well protected from exposure
to radio waves, and normally there is no need to fear possible malfunction
of medical equipment due to interference caused by exposure to radio
frequency emission by cellular devices. Nevertheless, the Ministry
of Health recommends keeping cellular devices away from medical implements
(30 to 50 cm) implanted in or carried by the patient.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health, Medicine Administration Section Circular
(of 2002) addressed to hospital directors indicates that the use of
cellular devices and two-way radio devices in hospitals must not pose
danger to the well-being and safety of patients, on one hand, while
allowing the staff, the patients and their family members to benefit
from service advantages. The circular specifies the areas of the medical
facilities in which the use of cellular devices is strictly forbidden
and the areas where it is permitted (while maintaining appropriate
distance from areas where life supporting systems and equipment are
operated).</p>
