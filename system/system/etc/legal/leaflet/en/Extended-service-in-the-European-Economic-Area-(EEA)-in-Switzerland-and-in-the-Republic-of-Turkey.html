<p>If you have purchased your device in a country/region member of
the European Economic Area (EEA) or in Switzerland or the Republic
of Turkey, and such device was intended for sale in the EEA or in
Switzerland or in Turkey, you can have your device serviced in any
EEA country/region or in Switzerland or in Turkey, under the warranty
conditions prevailing in the country/region in which you require servicing,
provided that an identical device is sold in such country/region by
an authorised <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> distributor. To find
out if your device is sold in the country/region you are in, please
call your local <span class="keep-together">Sony</span> Contact Center. Please
observe that certain services may not be possible elsewhere than in
the country/region of original purchase, for example, due to the fact
that your device may have an interior or exterior which is different
from equivalent models sold in other countries/regions. Please note
in addition that it may sometimes not be possible to repair SIM-locked
devices.</p>
