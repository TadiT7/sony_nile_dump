<li><span class="li-content"><p>This limited warranty is valid only if the original proof of
purchase for this device, issued by a Sony authorised dealer specifying,
unaltered, the date of purchase and serial number, is presented with
the device to be repaired or replaced.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Subject to local legislation, repairs to, or replacement of,
the device shall be warranted for the remaining time of the original
warranty period or for ninety (90) days from the date of repair, whichever
is longer unless otherwise required by local legislation. Repair or
replacement may involve the use of functionally equivalent components
or units. Replaced parts, components or units will become the property
of Sony.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"> <p>This warranty does not cover any failure of the device that
is due to:</p> <ul>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Normal wear and tear.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Use in environments where relevant IP rating limitations, if
applicable, are exceeded (including liquid damage or the detection
of liquid inside the device resulting from such use).</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Misuse or failure to use in accordance with the relevant Sony
instructions for use and maintenance of the device. </p></span></li>
</ul><p>Nor does this warranty cover any failure of the Product due
to accident, software or hardware modification or adjustment, or acts
of God.</p> </span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>A rechargeable battery can be charged and discharged more than
a hundred times. However, it will eventually wear out – this is not
a defect and corresponds to normal wear and tear. When the talk-time
or standby time becomes noticeably shorter, it is time to replace
the battery (only Sony Mobile repair partners should remove or replace
built-in batteries). Sony recommends that you use only batteries and
chargers approved by Sony.</p> <p>Minor variations in display brightness
and colour may occur between devices. There may be tiny bright or
dark dots on the display. These are called defective pixels and occur
when individual dots have malfunctioned and can not be adjusted. Two
defective pixels are deemed acceptable.</p> <p>Minor variations in
camera image appearance may occur between devices. Such variations
are not uncommon and do not mean that a camera module is defective.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Since the cellular system on which the device is to operate
is provided by a carrier independent from Sony, Sony will not be responsible
for the operation, availability, coverage, services or range of that
system.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"> <p>This warranty does not cover device failures caused by installations,
modifications, or repair or opening of the device performed by a non-Sony
authorised person.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>The warranty does not cover device failures which have been
caused by use of accessories or other peripheral devices which are
not Sony-branded original accessories intended for use with the device.</p> </span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Sony disclaims all warranties, whether express or implied,
for failures caused by viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or other malicious
software.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Some devices may provide or support GPS/Location based functions.
Location-determining functionality is provided "AS IS" and "WITH ALL
FAULTS". Sony does not make any representation or warranty as to the
accuracy of such location information. Use of location-based information
by the device may not be uninterrupted or error free and may additionally
be dependent on network service availability. Please note that functionality
may be reduced or prevented in certain environments such as building
interiors or areas adjacent to buildings.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p>Tampering with any of the seals on the device will void the
warranty.</p></span></li>
<li><span class="li-content"><p><span class="">This limited warranty sets out your
entire rights and remedies against Sony in relation to a defective
device. All implied warranties, including without limitation warranties
of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, are excluded.
In no event shall Sony or its licensors be liable for incidental or
consequential damages of any nature whatsoever, or for lost profits,
time or commercial loss, to the fullest extent these damages can be
disclaimed by law. </span></p> </span></li>
</ol></div>
<p>For jurisdictions where absolute exclusions of implied warranties
are not permitted, such warranties, if applicable, shall not exceed
the duration of the express warranties provided.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this warranty does not affect consumers’
statutory rights under applicable legislation.</p>
